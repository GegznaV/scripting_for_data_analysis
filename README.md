# Scripting for data analysis

*Martin Johnsson*

Scripting for data analysis with R is a PhD course set to be given in 2017. This repository contains the developing exercises and homework assignments.



## Course plan

### 1. A crash course in R

Before the seminar I'll send out instructions on how to setup R and RStudio so everyone can work along on their laptop.

Why do data analysis with a scripting language  
The RStudio interface  
Using R as a calculator  
Working interactively and writing code  
Getting help  
Reading and looking at data  
Installing useful packages  
A first graph with ggplot2

Homework for next time: The Unicorn Dataset, exercises in reading data, descriptive statistics, linear models and a few statistical graphs.


### 2. Programming for data analysis

Programming languages one may encounter in science  
Common concepts and code examples  
Data structures in R  
Vectors  
Data frames  
Functions  
Control flow

Homework for next time: The Unicorn Expression Dataset, exercises in data wrangling and more interesting graphs.


### 3. Working with moderately large data

Exercise followup  
More about functions  
Lists  
Objects  
Functional and imperative programming  
Doing things many times, loops and plyr  
Simulating data  
Working on a cluster

Final homework: Design analysis by simulation: pick a data analysis project that you care about; simulate
data based on a model and reasonable effect size;
implement the data analysis; and apply it to simulated data with and without effects to estimate
power and other design characteristics. This ties together skills from all seminars.
